- 👋 Hi, I’m Aman Singh, known by netizens as `theamanstark`.
- ✨ Somehow I turned 18 this year—quite a serious number, don't you think? 😶‍🌫️
- ❤️ I have a passion for painting and cooking. I have an aptitude for robotics and have constructed several robots throughout the years. In terms of academics, I find the realm of math to be quite interesting, with parabolas, shapes, trigonometry, and calculus.
